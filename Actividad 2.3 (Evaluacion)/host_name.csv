Since 2014, I've stablished myself in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, where we founded Believe Surf & Yoga. The aim was to transmit our passion with others: Surfing, yoga and healthy food.

As from August 2021, we manage Nautilus Surf & Yoga Villas, an ideal spot for surfers and yogis looking for the comfort of an entire place in a community of small villas, walking distance to the beach.

Since 2014, I've stablished myself in Santa Teresa, Costa Rica, where we founded Believe Surf & Yoga. The aim was to transmit our passion with others: Surfing, yoga and healthy food.

As from August 2021, we manage Nautilus Surf & Yoga Villas, an ideal spot for surfers and yogis looking for the comfort of an entire place in a community of small villas, walking distance to the beach.
