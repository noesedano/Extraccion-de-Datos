My enjoyable apartment is located in the most beautiful neighborhood in Buenos Aires, three blocks away from a gorgeous, gigantic park with a lake in it located where you can go running, hiking or walking. Subway, train and more than 20 buses take you everywhere. You will also enjoy buying your groceries at three supermarkets very close to my house. Also there is a small fancy mall with elegant stores and coffee shops one block away. The neighborhood is very secure as there are a lot of embassies. Also, the building has security guards.
I love this spot in Buenos Aires and I can assure you  will love it as much as I do.

The atmosphere in many cafÃ©s and restaurants strives to be ""alternative"", which makes this area of the city especially popular with young, upper-middle class Argentines as well as foreign tourists.

My enjoyable apartment is located in the most beautiful neighborhood in Buenos Aires, three blocks away from a gorgeous, gigantic park with a lake in it located where you can go running, hiking or walking. Subway, train and more than 20 buses take you everywhere. You will also enjoy buying your groceries at three supermarkets very close to my house. Also there is a small fancy mall with elegant stores and coffee shops one block away. The neighborhood is very secure as there are a lot of embassies. Also, the building has security guards.
I love this spot in Buenos Aires and I can assure you  will love it as much as I do.

Me encanta viajar, cocinar, leer y sacar fotos. Me gusta la aventura, viajar es una pasiÃ³n, conocer lugares y sabores nuevos. Viajar a todo tipo de destinos, recorrer ciudades, conocer su historia y las distintas culturas. Para vacaciones siempre elegimos la playa. Buscamos tranquilidad, soledad, contacto con la naturaleza, lo mÃ¡s agreste posible y las mejores olas. 
Como familia llevamos un estilo de vida sustentable, separamos nuestros residuos, cocinamos nuestra comida, cuidamos de nuestra huerta y evitamos todo consumo innecesario. Disfrutamos del confort siempre y cuando se respete la ecologÃ­a. Cuidamos el agua y nos encargamos de no malgastar este valioso recurso. 
Sumamente respetuosos de las demÃ¡s personas y su ambiente, cuidamos los lugares a donde vamos tanto como cuidamos nuestro hogar.
Respetamos y amamos a todos los animales y plantas, sabemos que el mundo no es Ãºnicamente de las personas y que nuestra Tierra es nuestra real y Ãºnica casa.

Its name comes from the Casa del Retiro, built at the beginning of this century at the intersection of the current Arenales and MaipÃº by the governor AgustÃ­n de Robles, very close to the hermitage of San SebastiÃ¡n, there existing already in 1608. Shortly afterwards the house was sold to the South Sea company, and was intended to house the slaves who had arrived in Buenos Aires.<br /><br />In 1800 construction work began on Plaza de Toros, whose contour is still maintained in Plaza San MartÃ­n, on Avenida Santa Fe. During the English invasions a memorable confrontation took place in it, following which the place received the name of Field of Glory. There the grenadiers under General JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n also received instruction, and the place began to have importance because of the barracks that moved the bullring.

Today from our hometown, Buenos Aires, we want to continue traveling through the people doing what passionate us: cultural exchange and travel experiences.

The history of human occupation in the area dates back to pre-Columbian times, when it was inhabited by original communities. During the colonial era, the area began to develop, mainly as rural areas and later as part of the growth of Buenos Aires to the north.<br /><br />In the late 19th century, Belgrano acquired political importance, as it was temporarily the capital of Argentina in 1880 during the crisis between Buenos Aires and the federal government. With the construction of the train and urban expansion, it was consolidated as an upper and upper-middle class neighborhood.<br /><br />An important factor in its development was the Vega stream, a watercourse that used to cross the area. Although today it is piped, it was key in the agricultural and livestock expansion of the region, and later in the urban layout, allowing the neighborhood infrastructure to grow around its channel.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-1257363828243552968/original/a66fc26c-1ea6-48b4-a082-1b403885bfc4.jpeg,85943422,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/85943422,Filipe,2016-07-25,"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Sou apaixonado pela vida, pela natureza, animais e busco cumprir minha funÃ§Ã£o aqui nessa viagem chamada existÃªncia.

Hace quince aÃ±os que vivo aquÃ­ luego de muchos aÃ±os de viajes y de vida en Europa. Vivi y estudiÃ© en Italia. Soy sociÃ³loga de formaciÃ³n, escritora y profesora de Yoga MÃ©todo Iyengar, Ceriticada en 2022. 
Adoro este lugar que fui armando a lo largo del tiempo. La biblioteca cuenta de mis intereses y de mis viajes. Las migraciones italianas, la inmigraciÃ³n italiana en Argentina y la alimentaciÃ³n como cultura e historia son algunos de mis mayores intereses, asÃ­ como el vino y la cocina del MediterrÃ¡neo. TambiÃ©n amo todo lo relacionado con el hilado y el tejido del lino que vuela en mis ventanas y subre mis colchones. La prÃ¡ctica del yoga ha sido fundamental para poner mis pies en la tierra, para sentirme vital y seguir disfrutando de la vida. TambiÃ©n tengo una huella fundamental. Mi estadÃ­a en Italia en un Hotel de campo me cambiÃ³ la vida.
